              Shepherd is a framework to build content moderation systems. The output of shepherd is a transaction id list that you can load with an Arweave node, in order to protect your node from storing and serving unwanted material. It uses a simple plugin architecture so that you are in control of what is filtered, and makes creating your own filters easier through the use of these plugins.

              Shepherd puts the control over content you want to filter fully in your hands. It handles all of the raw content from the weave data, filters out non-media and most invalid data, and passes it on to your filter plugin. What content you decide to filter is up to you and your moral and legal compliance needs. Your filter plug-in is fully customizable and allows you to filter anything you can build an AI classification filter for, or even use simpler filters such as blacklist/whitelist for a particular appâ€™s content media.

              To help you get started, @ArweaveTeam provides an NSFW content filter which you can load by adding the following to your Arweave start command:
            </Text>
            <CodeBox>
              transaction_blacklist_url http://shepherd-v.com/nsfw.txt
            </CodeBox>
            <Text textAlign='justify'>
              This content filter will be updated periodically in order to assure compliance with the legal stipulations of the jurisdictions where @ArweaveTeam operates: Germany and the United Kingdom. While the NSFW content filter will incorporate contents as law enforcement in the above jurisdictions requires, you are encouraged to ensure your own legal compliance in the jurisdictions where you operate in.
